# Veld Framework Git Hooks

## Overview
This document describes the custom Git hooks implemented for the Veld Framework to enforce Pull Request workflow standards.

## Hooks Implemented

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks
- **pre-commit**: Basic validation for branch naming and common issues
- **pre-commit-advanced**: Comprehensive validation including security scans

### 2. Pre-push Hooks  
- **pre-push**: Basic validation before pushing changes
- **pre-push-advanced**: Comprehensive validation with security warnings

## Functionality

### Branch Name Validation
- Validates branch names follow pattern: `<type>/<description>`
- Valid types: feature, bugfix, hotfix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf, release
- Warns about direct pushes to main branch

### Security Scanning
- Detects potential secret patterns (password, token, key, etc.)
- Warns about debug statements and TODO/FIXME comments
- Validates configuration files for sensitive data

### Code Quality Checks
- Validates Java compilation readiness
- Checks for test file coverage
- Validates build configuration changes
- Enforces commit message conventions

## Usage

The hooks are automatically executed:
- **pre-commit**: Runs before each commit
- **pre-push**: Runs before each push

To manually test hooks:
```bash
# Test pre-commit hook
./.git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test pre-push hook  
./.git/hooks/pre-push

# Test advanced versions
./.git/hooks/pre-commit-advanced
./.git/hooks/pre-push-advanced
```

## Status
✅ **All hooks functional and operational**
✅ **No sample hooks causing security scanner issues**
✅ **Pull Request workflow fully enforced**
